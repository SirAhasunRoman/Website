  <p>Going through an emotional rough patch earlier this week, and then (in an unconnected happenstance) watching <em>Gran Turismo</em> (I’d missed seeing the movie when it first came out in theaters), it started to dawn on me how much I’ve begun to value my “offline identity” relative to my “online identity”. Online, I talk about all the things I pontificate about on social media, blogs, podcasts, etc., and I write lots of code. Offline, I walk/cycle/scoot ( <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/micromobility" class="hashtag">#micromobility</a> has become very important to me!), meet new people, enjoy live music, and engage in a variety of activities with my <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/family" class="hashtag">#family</a> in and around <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/portland" class="hashtag">#Portland</a>.</p>

<p>Somehow, the “juice” I get out of life is trending in that direction: <strong>IRL</strong>. The reason <em>Gran Turismo</em> got me musing on this is because prior to this year, I’d <em>never</em> thought of myself as an “athlete”…<em>never</em> thought of myself as a “fitness buff”.</p>

<p><strong>I think that’s changing.</strong> And for this once-chubby nerd, it’s <em>super weird!</em> 😅 But super fun.</p>

<a href="/20240425/the-best-of-times" style="text-decoration-color:var(--grey-outlined)"><h3>The Best of Times</h3></a>

  

  <p>Two years ago today, IT HAPPENED. The worst timeline. Something that I really didn’t expect would actually come to fruition…<em>did</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Elon Musk’s buyout offer for Twitter was officially accepted.</strong> 🤡</p>

<p><a href="https://jaredwhite.com/20220425/back-to-the-open-web">As I wrote two years ago today:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back to the <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/openweb" class="hashtag">#openweb</a> I go. Not that I ever left it…but to be quite frank, it’s so easy to post and get immediate feeback on Twitter that I spend most of my day-to-day “chit-chat energy” there and not on my own website.</p>

  <p>No longer! Now that Elon Musk is buying Twitter and taking it private, I’m done putting serious effort into creating content for walled gardens. Everything, and I mean everything I publish from here on out will start on my own properties and then get syndicated elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership">In reporting at The Verge, Emma Roth and Russell Brandom pontificate</a> “it’s unclear what impact Musk will have on Twitter or where he’ll start with changes.”</p>

<p><strong>Oh boy.</strong></p>

<p>Now while I was extremely pessimistic about the buyout idea and in fact had written the previous day in my diary: “I will f***ing delete my Twitter account if Elon Musk buys Twitter” — I nevertheless spent the rest of summer 2022 ready to be impressed. Maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, Elon would be touched by the better angels of his nature, and find a path forward for Twitter that—if not <strong>excellent</strong>, at least would not be <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>

<p>🤡</p>

<p>I’ll save my “two years later” rundown for additional reporting over at The Internet Review, but even my worst fears were <em>quaint</em> by comparison to what actually transpired after Elon took over. As I wrote in <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/elongate">The Elon-gate’d Man</a> in November 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember all the people who—prior to the official takeover of Twitter—were telling us that Elon Musk would moderate his behavior and behave more like a grown up because too much money and prestige were at stake? Remember all the people who said that because Elon (seemingly) had been unilaterally successful in bringing us fancy new space rockets and fancy new electric cars, he could now bring welcome insight and innovation into a rapidly-degenerating and fractious social media landscape?</p>

  <p>Here’s the pertinent question: why do we keep believing this myth? As we’ve seen over recent years and especially recent months, it’s being proven decisively, tragically wrong…over and over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and in my exhortation of what we should be focusing on instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I am saying is unequivocal: down with surveillance capitalism eroding our trust and access to free and fair online communications. We can do better. We must do better. And increasingly—thanks to Mastodon, ActivityPub, and other open source projects &amp; protocols recently exploding in popularity—we are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth noting that arguably the biggest impact being made on social media  right now is the competitive response to the downfall of Twitter in the form of Threads, Meta’s broadcast-text-first social network. And the only reason Threads isn’t uniformly horrifying as a product is because it’s the first mass-market social network built with ActivityPub integration from the very start. (So that when <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/enshittification" class="hashtag">#enshittification</a> eventually comes, users and creators will have real options… 😅)</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/tag/fediverse" class="hashtag">#Fediverse</a>—the open social web—is growing exponentially</strong>, with Threads leading the pact of commercial properties doing a one-eighty from clinging to an outdated “silo” mindset, and Mastodon and other volunteer projects holding their own in providing open source access to social media. <em>Progress!</em> 👏</p>

<p>So while I still lament the death of Twitter, and the incalculable destruction of communities brought on by Elon Musk’s <em>abysmal</em> stranglehold over what is now X, I am also pleased to see how powerfully the momentum has shifted towards the Fediverse. <strong>It’s been the Worst of Times…and yet, the Best of Times.</strong></p>

  <p>Great advice from noted <strong>#</strong>WebDev podcaster Dave Rupert. I’ll add one more layer of commentary of top of the excellent points made in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Keep saying the same things repeatedly until you’re sick of it.</strong> 🤪</p>

<p>You know how folks complain about the weird quirk of human nature where if you hear somebody tell you the same lies over and over and over again, you start to believe them? Well if that’s true for nonsense, grifts, and psyops, just think how even <em>more</em> true that is for stuff that’s thoroughly legit.</p>

<p>A long time ago I realized that I couldn’t just voice a thought about an important topic once. <em>Haha! I wrote that single blog post! My job here is done!</em> or <em>I posted this hot take one time! Never again!</em> 😅</p>

<p>Gotta keep saying it. And saying it. And saying it. And saying it. Until you’re sick of it. And then say it some more.</p>

<p><strong>Now you’re an expert. Congratulations!</strong> 😜</p>

    <p>You can rarely go wrong visiting the tallest mountain in Oregon and a true jewel of the Cascades: Mt. Hood. This time, I visited in August 2023, taking the ski lifts up the slope from Timberline Lodge and then hiking back down while enjoying the epic views. Then I dropped by Trillium Lake for the first time. Wow! This location was definitely worth the hype. Gotta go back…</p>

    <p>There was a time not long ago when my life was in a major upheaval. Signs of online success were slim to none. I wasn’t sure if anyone out there would really care if I were suddenly Thanos-snapped out of existence. Yet the valuable lesson I came to learn during that dreadful time was how to become intrinsically motivated, the significance of value creation, and the trick of cultivating T-shaped skills.</p>
